# Python 100-Day Coding Challenge
Welcome to my Python 100-Day Coding Challenge repository! This initiative is all about pushing the boundaries of what I can build with Python. Over the course of 100 days, I'll be diving into a myriad of projects ranging from simple games to complex web applications, data analysis, and automation scripts. The goal is to improve my Python skills, understand various libraries and frameworks, and explore the vast potential of this versatile programming language.

## Challenge Overview
Each day, I tackle a new challenge, gradually increasing in complexity and variety. These challenges are designed to cover a broad spectrum of Python applications, including but not limited to:

- Games: Building classics like Blackjack, Snake Game, and Pong.
- Automation: Developing scripts for auto swiping on Tinder, auto job applications on LinkedIn, and automating birthday emails/SMS.
- Web Development: Creating a fully-fledged blog website.
- API Development: Designing and building a public API.
- Data Science: Performing analysis with Google Trends, analyzing Lego datasets, and conducting Google App Store analysis.
- ...and much more!

## Tools and Technologies Used
Throughout this challenge, I will be utilizing a variety of tools and technologies to accomplish the set goals, including:

- Python 3: The core programming language used for all challenges.
- Libraries and Frameworks: Depending on the project, I'll use Flask or Django for web development, Pandas and NumPy for data analysis, Pygame for game development, and several others.
- APIs: For projects requiring external data or services, I'll integrate various APIs.
- Databases: Utilizing SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB for projects requiring data persistence.
- Version Control: Git for tracking changes and GitHub for repository hosting.
